# iLyrics doesn't exclude "ft." or "feat." from song names? #

This behavior is not supported in iLyrics, however this functionality is currently available through [iTSfv](http://code.google.com/p/itsfv/).

# Only accepts exact matches? Would be nice to see a way to choose from close matches. #

This feature is planned for the future.
